# 7 Ways to Handle Missing Values in Machine Learning
# The real-world data often has a lot of missing values. The cause of missing values can be data corruption or failure to record data. The handling of missing data is very important during the preprocessing of the dataset as many learning algorithms do not support missing values.
# This article covers 7 ways to handle missing values in the dataset:

# 1.Deleting Rows with missing values
# 2.Impute missing values for continuous variable
# 3.Impute missing values for categorical variable
# 4.Other Imputation Methods
# 5.Using Algorithms that support missing values
# 6.Prediction of missing values
# 7.Imputation using Deep Learning Library â€” Datawig
